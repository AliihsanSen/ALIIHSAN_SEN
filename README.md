## About the Project
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ UI - Automation Test Project

‚ö°I wrote the automation code using the Java programming language and the Selenium library. <br>
‚ö°I used the TestNG framework to organize and execute UI tests efficiently. <br>
‚ö°I implemented modular methods in a BaseTest class to enhance code reusability and maintainability. <br>
‚ö°I validated web elements dynamically using locators managed through a LocatorManager utility. <br>
‚ö°Logging was handled systematically using a LoggingManager to ensure traceability and debugging efficiency. <br>
‚ö°Dynamic wait methods were employed to ensure reliable interactions with web elements. <br>
‚ö°Positive test scenarios included verifying page navigations, validating visible elements, and applying filters on open job positions. <br>
‚ö°I ensured accurate validation of job filters by matching job descriptions, departments, and locations. <br>
‚ö°User interactions such as hovering, scrolling, and switching between browser tabs were automated for seamless test coverage. <br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£  API - Test Automation Project

‚ö°I wrote the automation code using the Java programming language. <br>
‚ö°I utilized the RestAssured library for API testing. <br>
‚ö°Reusable methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests were implemented. <br>
‚ö°I validated the API responses by checking status codes and response bodies. <br>
‚ö°Dynamic headers and payloads were created for flexibility in testing. <br>
‚ö°I handled both positive and negative scenarios, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting pets. <br>
‚ö°I used https://petstore.swagger.io/v2 as the Base URL for API requests. <br>
‚ö°Helper classes, including BaseApiTest and ApiTestMethods, were developed to enhance code reusability. <br>
