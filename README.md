## About the Project
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ UI - Automation Test Project

‚ö°I wrote the automation code using the Java programming language and the Selenium library. <br>
‚ö°I used the TestNG framework to organize and execute UI tests efficiently. <br>
‚ö°I implemented modular methods in a BaseTest class to enhance code reusability and maintainability. <br>
‚ö°I validated web elements dynamically using locators managed through a LocatorManager utility. <br>
‚ö°Logging was handled systematically using a LoggingManager to ensure traceability and debugging efficiency. <br>
‚ö°Dynamic wait methods were employed to ensure reliable interactions with web elements. <br>
‚ö°Positive test scenarios included verifying page navigations, validating visible elements, and applying filters on open job positions. <br>
‚ö°I ensured accurate validation of job filters by matching job descriptions, departments, and locations. <br>
‚ö°User interactions such as hovering, scrolling, and switching between browser tabs were automated for seamless test coverage. <br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£  API - Test Automation Project

‚ö°I wrote the automation code using the Java programming language. <br>
‚ö°I utilized the RestAssured library for API testing. <br>
‚ö°Reusable methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests were implemented. <br>
‚ö°I validated the API responses by checking status codes and response bodies. <br>
‚ö°Dynamic headers and payloads were created for flexibility in testing. <br>
‚ö°I handled both positive and negative scenarios, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting pets. <br>
‚ö°I used https://petstore.swagger.io/v2 as the Base URL for API requests. <br>
‚ö°Helper classes, including BaseApiTest and ApiTestMethods, were developed to enhance code reusability. <br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Load Test Project

‚ö°I used Apache JMeter to create and execute the load test scenarios. <br>
‚ö°The test plan, named "Load Test Insider," was designed to simulate user activity on the N11 platform. <br>
‚ö°A thread group, titled "N11 - Load Test," was configured to define the number of users and their behavior under load conditions. <br>
‚ö°HTTP requests, such as "n11 - Search - Load Test," were crafted to mimic real-world search operations on the platform. <br>
‚ö°Key performance metrics, including response time and throughput, were captured during the test execution. <br>
‚ö°The load test focused on validating the system's ability to handle concurrent user requests effectively. <br>
‚ö°Test results were analyzed to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure scalability under peak loads. <br>
